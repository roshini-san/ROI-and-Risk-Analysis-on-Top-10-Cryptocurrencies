# ROI-and-Risk-Analysis-on-Top-10-Cryptocurrencies
This project aims to analyze and compare the investment potential of top ten leading cryptocurrencies during August 2024: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, Solana, USDC, XRP, Cardano, Dogecoin and Toncoin. By performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Return on Investment (ROI) analysis, and risk assessment on historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data, this research seeks to identify the optimal investment choices among these cryptocurrencies. The decision-making framework is based on categorizing each cryptocurrency into one of four investment profiles: High ROI-High Risk, High ROI-Low Risk, Low ROI-High Risk and Low ROI-Low Risk. These profiles cater to different investor risk appetites and return expectations. The goal is to provide insights that guide investors in selecting cryptocurrencies that align with their investment strategies, whether they seek high returns with higher risks or prefer stable returns with lower risks.
